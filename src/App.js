// peer reviewd by Jovann : app brings in data overall look looks awesome data displays but there are no icons for me to see which I think should of been added. I like the responsiveness more time and this app would of been working great.

import './App.css';
import MainComponent from './component/MainComponent';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <MainComponent/>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
